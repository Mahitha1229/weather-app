## Project Overview

Weather App is a responsive web application that displays real-time weather data based on user-input locations. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve live temperature, weather conditions, and atmospheric details. Built with Vite for blazing-fast development and TailwindCSS for utility-driven styling, this project demonstrates efficient data handling, API integration, and component-based UI design using TypeScript.

Key highlights:
- Dynamic city-based weather search
- Modular architecture with reusable components
- Secure API key management via environment variables
- Fully responsive UI across devices

This project was developed as part of a Web Development Internship, focused on mastering real-world implementation of modern frontend tools and frameworks.
